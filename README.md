# public_utulities
A database that stores data about the interaction of a citizen 
and public utilities.
Includes tables of citizens, apartments, houses, and utility 
substations of electricity, water, heating, and gas.
The main goal of the project is to make the work of management companies
 more transparent and simplify the interaction of residents 
 of the city with public utilities.
